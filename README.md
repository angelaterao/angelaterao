### Hi, I'm Angela 👋🏻👩🏻‍💻

I'm a self-taught iOS developer 📱, with a unique twist – I spent 4 years immersed in the world of market finance 📈 before diving headfirst into coding through Udemy and YouTube courses. Now, I'm all about putting my self-taught skills to work and building awesome apps! 🚀✨

🔍 I'm constantly exploring new horizons and learning all the things! 🧠  
💡 Passionate about turning caffeine into code and dreams into digital reality. ☕✨  
📚 I believe in the power of lifelong learning, so expect my brain to be a constant work-in-progress! 💪🏻  

But my curiosity knows no bounds! I'm on a quest to master not only the art of coding but also explore a diverse array of interests. 🌟  

🏋️‍♂️ When I'm not chasing bugs, you'll find me chasing personal records in CrossFit, pushing my limits one workout at a time! 🏋️‍♂️   
🏃‍♂️ I'm a sports enthusiast who loves running, swimming, climbing, and I'm always open to trying new sports and activities! 🏊‍♂️🧗‍♂️  
🎨 I'm also a creative enthusiast, wielding my skills in Procreate, crochet, and painting to bring my imagination to life. 🎨  

Join me on this eclectic journey as we turn ideas into pixels, build apps that leave a mark, and maybe even swap coding tips for CrossFit PRs or artistry secrets! Let's connect, collaborate, and code together! 💻🫱🏻‍🫲🏽
