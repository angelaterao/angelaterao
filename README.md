# Hey there! I'm Angela 👋🏻👩🏻‍💻

Before diving headfirst into coding through Udemy and YouTube courses, I spent 4 years in the world of market finance.  
Now, I'm all about putting my self-taught skills to work and building awesome apps!

🔍 I'm on a continuous journey of mastering Swift and learning all the nuances of this powerful language. 🧠   
☕ I'm passionate about turning caffeine into code and creating apps that push boundaries. 🚀

But my curiosity knows no bounds! I'm on a quest to master not only the art of coding but also explore a diverse array of interests..

🏋️‍♂️ When I'm not chasing bugs, you'll find me pushing my physical limits at CrossFit and through various sports. 🏃🏊‍♀️🧗‍♀️  
🎨 I'm also a creative enthusiast, applying my skills in Procreate, crochet, and painting to bring my imagination to life. ✨

Let's connect, collaborate, and code together! 💻🫱🏻‍🫲🏽
